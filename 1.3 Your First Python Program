Once Python is installed, letâ€™s write the classic "Hello, World!" program.
This is the simplest program that displays a message to the screen.

code:
print("Hello, World!")

Try running it in your terminal, IDE, or online platform.

In the terminal:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python file (e.g., hello.py).
Type: python hello.py and hit Enter.
In IDE: Simply write the code and run it using the "Run" button.
